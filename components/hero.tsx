        Welcome to my digital playground! I'm Ayush Ray, a passionate developer
        who thrives on the thrill of bringing ideas to life through code.
        Whether it's building cutting-edge software, deploying scalable
        solutions, or exploring new technologies, I'm always on the hunt for the
        next challenge. My approach to development is much like Tony Stark's
        approach to engineeringâ€”relentless innovation, a drive to push
        boundaries, and a bit of flair. Let's build the future, one line of code
        at a time.
      </p>
